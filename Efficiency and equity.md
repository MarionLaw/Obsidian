Although these policies havethe benefit of achieving greater equity, they have a cost in terms of reduced effi-ciency. When the government redistributes income from the rich to the poor, it re-duces the reward for working hard; as a result, people work less and producefewer goods and services. In other words, when the government tries to cut theeconomic pie into more equal slices, the pie gets smaller.

Recognizing that people face tradeoffs does not by itself tell us what decisionsthey will or should make. A student should not abandon the study of psychologyjust because doing so would increase the time available for the study of econom-ics. Society should not stop protecting the environment just because environmen-tal regulations reduce our material standard of living. The poor should not beignored just because helping them distorts work incentives. Nonetheless, ac-knowledging lifeâ€™s tradeoffs is important because people are likely to make gooddecisions only if they understand the options that they have available.
